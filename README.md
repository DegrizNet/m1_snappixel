# OpenMage (Magento 1.9) - Snap Pixel events (Archived)

The Snap Pixel module for Magento integrates Snapchat's tracking capabilities into your site, enabling you to optimize your advertising campaigns on Snapchat. By adding this module, you can measure the cross-device impact of your campaigns and understand how Snapchatters interact with your website after viewing your ads.

## Features
- **Cross-Device Tracking:** Measure the impact of your Snapchat ads across different devices.
- **Campaign Optimization:** Gain insights into how users engage with your site after interacting with your ads.
- **Direct Response Goals:** Effectively track and optimize for goals such as driving leads, customer registrations, and product sales.

The Snap Pixel is a JavaScript code snippet that allows advertisers to see how many Snapchat users take action on their website(s) after viewing their ad. This tracking is essential for understanding user behavior beyond a single session or device.
